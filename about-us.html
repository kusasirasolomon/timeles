            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There are millions of children across the world who do not have enough food to eat every day, who do not
                attend school, live in slums or on the streets, suffer from untreated diseases, are abused and
                mistreated, die early, and never get the opportunities we take for granted. These children have no one
                to turn to and Uganda has not been an exceptional to this as the situation is worse compared to other
                countries more so in our areas of operation.</p>
            <p>TIMELESS ANGELS UGANDA has been Helping Orphaned, Poor and Exploited children in the country since its
                inception? With our implementing partners, a lot has been achieved. Many other developments have taken
                place such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An increase in number of children accessing better education, safe water, sanitation, medical
                    services, basic, legal and nutritional support though still inadequate.</li>
                <li>Development of systems, policies and procedures that facilitate organizational effectiveness in the
                    child care sector most especially at household level in rural communities.</li>
                <li>Greater focus and consolidation of TIMELESS ANGELS UGANDA’s efforts in other parts of the country
                    and with fewer partners so that impact for children is more effectively assured.</li>
                <li>Development and use of a clear Child Protection Policy and Code of Conduct.</li>
                <li>Initiation of the early childhood development program, advocating for children rights at grassroots
                    levels.</li>
                <li>Supporting better environment for better children growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are proud that these changes have resulted in firstly and foremost an increase in the number of
                children we have supported year on year.</p>

            <h2>Way Forward</h2>
            <p>In TIMELESS ANGELS UGANDA children support program, we want to strive to help even more children and to
                do what we do as best as we can. This strategy sets the direction of our work for the next coming years
                and now. It offers guidance to staff, trustees and volunteers to shape and focus our plans for the
                future. It is also useful to our partners who are at the forefront of implementing change for the lives
                of the children we care for most, and to our supporters whose generosity and belief in our work make it
                possible for our programs to continue.</p>
            <p>This strategy builds on the successes of the past and seeks to optimize our contribution to improve the
                lives of the children who are at the heart of our work. TIMELESS ANGELS UGANDA Children program exists
                to Help Orphaned, Poor, Exploited and other marginalized children in the country.</p>
